Step 1
Ubuntu 18.04 supplied with both Python 3 and Python 2 pre-installed.
To make sure that our versions are up-to-date, let’s update and upgrade the system with apt-get:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
The -y flag will confirm that we are agreeing for all items to be installed.


Step 2
Once the process is complete, we can check the version of Python 3 that is installed in the system by typing:

$ python3 --version
You will receive output in the terminal window that will let you know the version number. The version number may vary, but it will look similar to this:

Output
Python 3.6.5


Step 3
To manage software packages for Python, let’s install pip:

$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
A tool for use with Python, pip installs and manages programming packages we may want to use in our development projects.

You can install Python packages by typing:

$ pip3 install package_name
Here, package_name can refer to any Python package or library, such as Django for web development or NumPy for scientific computing.

So if you would like to install Pandas, you can do so with the command pip3 install pandas.

There are a few more packages and development tools to install to ensure that we have a robust set-up for our programming environment:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
Once Python is set up, and pip and other tools are installed, we can set up a virtual environment for our development projects.
